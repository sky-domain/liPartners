        within the Greater Toronto Area's Chinese community. According to statistics from First Canadian Title ("FCT"), 
        Canada's largest title insurance company, the transaction volume of Li & Partners Law Firm consistently 
        ranked among the top 25% of FCT's volume across all of Canada from 2014 until prior to the pandemic 
        (as noted in <a href="firmUpdates.html"> Firm Updates </a>).

        In addition to residential real estate, Li & Partners Law Firm is seeing strong growth in commercial real estate projects
         and corporate investment and financing. Mr. Li currently assists investors in Toronto with the acquisition 
         of major commercial real estate projects, including gas stations, office buildings, golf courses, large warehouses,
