    <h2 class="text_center">Understanding Discusses Title Insurance </h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">By Mr. Li, Shu Kuan | Li & Partners</h3>
    <div class="about-description">
      <p>
        Many homebuyers in Ontario hear about title insurance when purchasing property, 
        but few know what it truly means. Title insurance is a key way real-estate lawyers 
        protect clients's interests during property transactions — and it has now become standard practice 
        across Canada.
      </p>
      <h3>What Is Title Insurance?</h3>
      <p>
        Title insurance protects property owners and lenders against certain losses related to defects or 
        issues with the legal ownership (title) of real estate.
      </p>
      <p>It covers risks such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Undiscovered liens or encumbrances</li>
        <li>Fraud or forgery affecting title</li>
        <li>Errors in public records</li>
        <li>Unknown defects that may surface after closing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With title insurance, the buyer and lender gain peace of mind that their legal ownership is protected.</p>
      <h3>How Title Insurance Came to Canada</h3>
      <p>The concept was introduced from the United States in the early 2000s.
        Before then, Ontario real-estate lawyers had to conduct full due diligence for each transaction — 
        an extensive, time-consuming, and costly process to verify title.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the property market accelerated, buyers and lenders demanded faster closings and 
        stronger post-closing protection. Title insurance met those needs and was soon accepted 
        by law societies across Canada.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        When a transaction begins, the title insurer reviews the agreement of purchase and sale and the title search.
      </p>
      <p>It then determines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which issues require no investigation</li>
        <li>Which can be insured with partial verification</li>
        <li>Which need full due diligence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zoning and working-order issues on most residential properties are often covered without extra investigation.</li>
        <li>Property-tax matters may require signed declarations from the seller.</li>
        <li>Mortgages and liens still demand complete title review.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach streamlines the process, saving time and cost for both lawyer and client.</p>
      <h3>Why Lawyers Recommend Title Insurance</h3>
      <h4>1. Broader Protection</h4>
      <p>A lawyer's certification of title is limited to what can reasonably be discovered through investigation.
        Some defects, however, are hidden and may only appear after closing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Title insurance provides contractual coverage — 
        once issued, the insurer is legally bound to compensate for covered risks.
      </p>
      <p><i>
        Note: Title insurance and legal certification both focus only on title-related issues.
        Unpaid utilities or other personal debts are not title defects and are therefore excluded.
      </i></p>
      <h4>2. No Need for a New Survey</h4>
      <p>
        Most homeowners lack an up-to-date property survey.
        Title insurers typically do not require one and still provide coverage for risks that might 
        otherwise appear only on a new survey — saving time and money.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Lower Time and Legal Costs</h4>
      <p>
        Modern real-estate deals close quickly — sometimes within a week.
        Without title insurance, such timelines would be nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>Because title insurance reduces due-diligence requirements, buyers benefit from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower legal fees</li>
        <li>Fewer disbursements and government charges</li>
        <li>Shorter transaction cycles</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Approved Title Insurers in Ontario</h3>
      <p>
        The Law Society of Ontario and the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) 
        have authorized several companies to provide title insurance to homebuyers and lenders:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Canadian Title (FCT)</li>
        <li>Stewart Title Insurance</li>
        <li>TitlePlus</li>
        <li>Chicago Title</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TitlePlus is affiliated with the Law Society of Ontario.</p>
      <p>
        First Canadian Title (FCT) — a subsidiary of First American Title (U.S.) — 
        entered the Ontario market early and remains the largest provider.
        Most financial institutions accept FCT policies for mortgage lending.
      </p>
      <h3>Li & Partners' Experience with Title Insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Li & Partners' has maintained a long-term partnership with First Canadian Title (FCT).
        From 2014 to 2016, Li & Partners ranked among Top 25% nationwide in Canada — 
        reaching 11th place in 2016. </p>
      <p>
        Through this collaboration, Li & Partners helps clients and lenders secure title policies efficiently 
        and close transactions smoothly.
      </p>
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        As Canada's real-estate market continues to evolve, new developments in title protection and 
        insurance may emerge. For now, title insurance remains an essential safeguard for both homebuyers 
        and mortgage lenders.
