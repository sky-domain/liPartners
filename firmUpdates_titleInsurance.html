    <h2 class="text_center">Mr. Li Discusses Title Insurance </h2>
    <div class="about-description">
      <p>
        Many real estate buyers come across the concept of title insurance, 
        though few truly understand what it means and how it works. 
        Title insurance is a mechanism used by real estate lawyers to protect 
        the interests of their buyer clients — 
        it has now become a standard practice in modern real estate transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of title insurance was introduced from the United States to Canada around the early 2000s. 
        Before that, real estate lawyers had to conduct full due diligence on behalf of buyers to ensure 
        the title was clear before closing. This process was time-consuming and costly. 
        After reviewing all due diligence reports, the lawyer would then certify that the title 
        met contractual requirements, including its marketability and transferability.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Ontario's real estate market developed rapidly, buyers and lenders demanded faster 
        closings and stronger post-closing protection. Title insurance emerged under these circumstances 
        and was gradually accepted by provincial law societies across Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Title insurance mainly affects a real estate lawyer's due diligence work. 
        Its operation is quite simple: after reviewing the purchase agreement and title search report, 
        the title insurance company categorizes title-related risks — determining which ones require 
        no due diligence, which need partial investigation and specific signed documents, 
        and which require full examination.
      </p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For most non-commercial properties, issues like zoning or working order usually don't require investigation.</li>
        <li>For property taxes, the seller needs to provide and sign certain documents.</li>
        <li>For liens or encumbrances such as mortgages or construction liens, full investigation is still required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This system simplifies the transaction process. Nowadays, real estate lawyers can protect buyers' rights in two ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Title certification based on full due diligence;</li>
        <li>Title insurance.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The latter has become the more commonly accepted method, for several reasons:</p>
      <p>
        First, a lawyer's certification is based only on reasonable due diligence — 
        it covers less risk than title insurance. Lawyers can only certify title based on 
        what could reasonably be discovered according to professional standards, 
        but title defects are often complex and may fall outside that scope.
        Some issues cannot be detected even by thorough investigation,
        which may ultimately harm the buyer's interest. Title insurance, however, 
        creates a contractual obligation — once issued, the insurer is legally bound to provide protection to the insured.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to note that this protection applies only to title-related risks. 
        Matters like unpaid utility bills (gas, electricity, etc.) are not covered by title certification 
        or title insurance, because they are debts (creditor-debtor issues), 
        not title-related rights (property interests). Current law does not allow creditors to 
        attach such unpaid debts to a property's title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, most freehold resale homeowners don't have an up-to-date survey of their property. 
        Title insurers typically don't require such surveys and will insure title even without one 
        — saving buyers the time and cost of commissioning a new survey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, title insurance greatly reduces both time and cost for buyers. Real estate transactions today
        move much faster — from signing to closing in as little as a week. Without title insurance, 
        this would be nearly impossible. Time savings directly translate into financial savings, 
        since a lawyer's fees and related disbursements increase with the amount of investigation required. 
        In the past, due diligence and certification could cost several thousand dollars, 
        plus additional government and surveyor fees — an unthinkable expense for today's homebuyers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the emergence of title insurance was no accident but a result of modern market development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Ontario, the Law Society and the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) 
        have approved several insurers to offer title insurance to homebuyers and mortgage lenders 
        (including banks and private lenders):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Canadian Title (FCT)</li>
        <li>Stewart Title Insurance</li>
        <li>TitlePlus</li>
        <li>Chicago Title</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Among them, TitlePlus is affiliated with the Law Society of Ontario, while First Canadian Title (FCT), 
        a subsidiary of First American Title in the U.S., was one of the first and remains the largest provider 
        in the Ontario market. Most financial institutions accept FCT policies for mortgage issuance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Real estate lawyers often maintain close working relationships with one or more title insurers for 
        efficient communication, such as submitting title documents and discussing underwriting issues. 
        This helps clients and lenders obtain policies smoothly before closing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Li & Partners has maintained a long-term relationship with First Canadian Title (FCT). 
        From 2014 to 2016, Li & Partners' transaction volumne ranked Top 25% nationwide in Canada.
        Specifically, Li & Partners ranked 11th in 2016 out of more than 1,000 real estate law firms.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the real estate market continues to evolve, we will see whether new mechanisms for 
        title protection or new developments in title insurance will emerge.
